# Object Detection Model

An object detection model using OpenCV’s DNN module to perform real-time object detection using a pre-trained SSD MobileNet model.

# Model Used

SSD = Single Shot MultiBox Detector

MobileNet = A lightweight neural network architecture optimized for mobile and real-time applications.


# Detection Algorithm

SSD is a deep learning object detection algorithm.

It detects objects in images using a single forward pass through the network (hence “single shot”).

It predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from feature maps at multiple scales.
